### Machine Learning

1. Tensorflow-Keras:
  - [Keras](https://keras.io/) - The official API for tensorflow. Beginner friendly and flexible.
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) - Google's machine learning platform, provides excellent deployment tools  
2. [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) - An excellent book for deep learning by Fran√ßois Chollet(Creator of Keras and a Deep Learning researcher at Google)
3. [Fast.ai courses](https://www.fast.ai/) - fast ai is a deep learning library built on top of PyTorch. It is extremely easy to use. The fastai courses are brilliant and teach deep learning from a more practical perspective.
4. [Scikit Learn tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) - An extensively used ML library, very easy to use and provides out of the box implementations of classical ML models.
5. [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) - This blog covers a huge variety of topics and problem types in ML

### Computer Vision

1. [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) - an awesome blog to learn about computer vision and deep learning
2. [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.3.0/) (Open Computer Vision library) - A great open source Computer Vision library which is extensively documented and is available in Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.
   - [C++ API docs](https://docs.opencv.org/4.3.0/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html)
   - [Python API docs](https://docs.opencv.org/4.3.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)
