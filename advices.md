# 2016 - 2020 batch advices:

## Advice 1:

The process varies for what kind of profile you sit for.
However adding to what Vivian said, brushing up on basic aptitude always helps, to get to the further rounds.

For coding related profiles, solving problems on hackerrank (interview preparation kit) can get you started, or even on codechef for that matter. Many companies use, hackerrank for screening candidates.
The latter part of the interview usually revolve around, social skills (GD) and mostly followed by interviews (it helps to have a clear purpose on what you are to do ahead, even incase you don't strictly plan to adhere to it).

Sat for interviews of data science related companies, he might give better overview of the process, if you ask more specific questions here.

Will link up some resources to improving on aptitude.
followed with some suggestions on improving apti from a senior who got into Robert Bosch bangalore.


## Advice 2:
Hi Guys,
I hope your quarrentine is safe and well. 
Just wanted to answer a quick set of questions put across me. 

For aptitude one can refer to a multitude of sources including the preparation courses for higher studies(GRE, GMAT,etc.) which do help mould your brain. Online assessment and tests help too. 

Studying coding becomes a little broad question but if someone needs to start from the very basics and have got some time on their hands, coursera could be a good option given that Manipal provides it for free as well. If one already knows and wants to just sharpen the knife, them any online platform promoting competitive coding works

If one is looking for placement in core sectors via our branch, focusing in strengthening the basics of mechanical works better because we are a sub branch of mechanical and accordingly always grouped with them in core companies. 

And definitely, golden source, reach out to your faculty and seniors. They'll help guide you.  Help you figure out the specifics. No need to get worked up as to how we are being effected because of Corona and recession. 
P.S. A fact, India is expected to be one of the  countries where recession won't create havoc as much as a few developed ones this time owing to circumstances. I urge you to read about it 
:)
For mechanical specific preparation, basics of thermodynamics should definitely be brushed upon (because it's not as intuitive as the rest and definitely contributes to a big chunk) followed by materials of solids, theory of machines, manufacturing techniques. Also, even though we, in mechatronics, are not taught this, fluid mechanics. 

For resources, we were referred to a good repository by Shashank Sir. I don't have it handy right now. If any of te seniors do have it, please share. 

Also, there's a book series called the "Schaum's outlines" which provides like a crash course for every subject out there. It's not too great but definitely helpful for a final brushup before entering the hall (helpful in higher studies exams as well with the same principles) . I had a few of them downloaded. Will upload to a central drive location and share if needed. Do let me know. 
:)


## Advice 3:
If I can clear GD and make it to the PI round with my (non-existent) CV I think just about anyone can get placed. Time and luck are the major factors at play sadly.

Technical skills and knowledge are obv needed but you need to be able to present yourself and your knowledge to the interviewer as well. 

I honestly feel this isn't stressed on enough. 
Looking up and deciding on profiles is vv important as you can accordingly decide what you have to prepare for thus saving yourself a lot of time and energy.

And honestly the OTs (from what I've heard feel free to interject) are usually unoriginal, coding tests are copied from a couple of sites like geeksforgeeks, for MAT they have a set of trick questions to choose from, the rest idk so can't comment on.


TLDR: Work smart not hard





## Advice 4:
GeeksForGeeks will be your best friend for a lot of OT questions and interview questions. As long as you prepare for the role properly and can talk well enough, you should be able to clear the GDs and get a chance to interview.


## Advice 5:

Here's my take on placements.

If you came to college thinking that you're going to get placed just because you attended college, that's the main reason why you probably won't get placed. 

It's about achieving a balance between work and fun. For me that balance would come at 20% work and 80% fun. But make that 20% count.

One thing I've observed about most juniors and people in our batch, (Not just Mechatronics, but MIT 2020) is that people just want to fill their resume up with something. Many people feel that they don't have a good resume so they aren't confident. Your goal should not be to fill your resume as an assignment last minute.

Unfortunately, everyone's aim is just to fill the resume. And that's the problem. What almost everyone in MIT skips is the fact is that your aim and your goal should be to learn and do something with the knowledge you acquire. Your resume will fill up automatically. Don't work too hard. But when you work, do it well with your heart and soul and then get back to having all the fun you want.

When interviewers come to the campus for hiring. They don't really care about your engineering "knowledge". They care about your drive to do something. What they want to see is initiative. Most people who are placed will relate that the work done during internship is very very different from what we "studied" in college. That information is just a foundation. But how you perform at work depends on your inner drive.

During my interview the interviewer asked me the bending moment equation. I simply told him I don't remember it but I know how to apply the concept. But again. it wasn't the knowledge that they were looking for. It was the initiative to do something.

Look, have a drive deep down. That's the most important part you need.And if you don't find that drive and passion in engineering, look for a career elsewhere in something you actually love because that's the only way you'll do well. Else you'll just become a depressed 9-5 robo. Placements and jobs will be secondary.



But the companies that did come to recruit at our college are all reputable respectable companies that want to provide equal opportunity to everyone in a fair manner. If they got placed, that's because they deserved it. 

And for those of us who are placed but have lost jobs or those pursuing higher studies who have been denied some opportunities due to the pandemic, please stay strong and hang in there. We're all in this togetherüí™üèª
